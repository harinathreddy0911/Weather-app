# Weather-app 
Weather App is a web application that provides up-to-date weather information for any location in the world. This website was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and the RapidAPI platform.

With Weather App, users can search for weather conditions in any city or town and get real-time updates on temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and more. The app features a clean and user-friendly interface, with intuitive controls and clear visualizations that make it easy to read and interpret weather data.

To build this app, I used a combination of front-end web technologies and third-party APIs. The HTML and CSS code was used to structure and style the app's layout, while JavaScript was used to implement dynamic functionality such as the search bar and real-time weather updates. Bootstrap was used to enhance the visual design and improve responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes.

The app also leverages the power of the RapidAPI platform to access weather data from a variety of sources, ensuring that users always get accurate and reliable information. With this app, users can stay informed about the weather conditions in their area and plan their activities accordingly.

Overall, Weather App is a powerful and easy-to-use weather application
